School Project Description: Online Bookstore:
This task is part of a school project aimed at developing skills in website development and information systems. The project is assigned to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical scenario by creating an informational website for a bookstore.

In this project, I am responsible for designing and developing a bookstore website that provides details about available books, categories, and featured recommendations. The website will serve as an informational platform rather than an e-commerce system, meaning it will not handle transactions but will focus on presenting book details attractively.

This project helps improve my understanding of web development, user interface design, and information management. The final result will be part of my academic assessment and a valuable addition to my portfolio.
